# TODO -> Display numbers 4 to 10 using a while loop



# TODO -> Display the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 using a for loop



# TODO -> Display the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 using a while loop



# TODO -> Write code to request someone's age.  The age must be between 0 and 120.
#         Continue requesting their age until correct.



# TODO -> Write code to request someone's ZIP code.  ZIP code must be 5 digits.
#         Continue requesting the ZIP code until correct.



# TODO -> Write code to request a number beween 1 and 1,000,000 and it
#         must contain at least 3 fours in it. For Example: 123456 is bad.
#         142434 is a good number. 10444444 is bad (too large)
#         Continue requesting the number until correct.
#         Hint:  There is a function called count() for strings



# TODO -> Write code to request 3 integers of the same value.  If the user
#         enters 3 integers that are not the same, ask them again until they get it right.



# TODO -> Without referring to the lesson notes or Internet, implement a simple
#         guessing game.  You can use random.randint(1, 100) to generate a number
#         to guess.
#
# Sample output:
#
# Enter guess: 50
# too low
# Enter guess: 60
# too high
# Enter guess: 55
# correct in 3 guesses
