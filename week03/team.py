# Strings

# TODO -> Create a string variable that contains 'hello world' and display it


# TODO -> Create two variables
#         1) givenName that contains your first name
#         2) surname that contains your surname
#      -> Display both on one line with a space between them (ie., John Brown)


# TODO -> With the two variables above, use the + operator to create a new
#         variable called name that contains both the given and surname and
#         display it to the screen. (ie., 'John Brown')


# TODO -> Using the variable alphabet below, display the 3rd character.
alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Integers

# TODO -> Create a variable that is equal to your age and display it
#         Call this variable 'age'


# TODO -> Using the variable age, add 10 years to it and display it


# TODO -> Using the variable age, multiple it by 3 and display it


# TODO -> Using the variable age, divide it by 3 and display it


# TODO -> Using the above variables, givenName, surname and age,
#         display them in the format:
#
#              My name is John Brown, and I'm 20 ages old



# TODO -> Add the following variables together and display the total
value1 = 12
value2 = 92
value3 = 52


# TODO -> Using the three variables above, calculate their average 
#         and display it


# TODO -> Divide 10 by 3 and display the answer as a integer


# TODO -> Divide 10 by 3 and display the answer as a float


# TODO -> Divide 10 by 3 and display the remainder (Modulo) as an integer


# TODO -> Write this number game in Python code. 
#         Create a variable to hold an integer and
#         use math operators to change that variable to get
#         the final answer.
#
#         Take a number. 
#         Double it.
#         Add 9.
#         Subtract 3.
#         Divide by 2. 
#         Subtract your original number.
#         Display your answer. Should be 3.
