    verses.append('For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow that the root and the top may be equal in strength until the good shall overcome the bad and the bad be hewn down and cast into the fire that they cumber not the ground of my vineyard and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard')

    verses.append('And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them Go to and labor in the vineyard with your might For behold this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard for the end is nigh at hand and the season speedily cometh and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come')
    verses.append('And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things')
    verses.append('And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard and the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to be cast away and they did keep the root and the top thereof equal according to the strength thereof')

    verses.append('And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good and that his vineyard was no more corrupt he called up his servants and said unto them Behold for this last time have we nourished my vineyard and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will and I have preserved the natural fruit that it is good even like as it was in the beginning And blessed art thou for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard and have kept my commandments and have brought unto me again the natural fruit that my vineyard is no more corrupted and the bad is cast away behold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard')
