# 03 - Project : Tithing Calculator

# 0 - Setup

The following project will require you write and run your own Python code.  There are a number of ways to do this.

- Thonny on your computer.
- Online sites such as https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ or https://www.trinket.io/.  You are able to create free accounts on these websites.
- You are free to write your project in either version 2 or 3 of Python.  However, I would prefer you write your project using Python 3.  Just remember what the differences are between version 2 and 3.


# 1 - Objectives

- Prompt the user for the amount of money earned last week.
- Prompt the user for the amount of money paid in fast offerings.
- Calculate tithing and total tithing with fast offerings.

# 2 - Overview

This project will implement a simple Tithing calulator.

# 3 - Instructions

## 3.1 - Sample Code

Here is some sample Python 3 code to prompt the user for different money values.  

```python
moneyEarned = int(input('Enter how much money you earned: '))
fastOffering = int(input('Enter how much you would like to pay for fast offerings: '))

# Your code goes here
# You should calculate how much tithing should be paid
# Tithing Owed = 10% of moneyEarned

# You should calculate the total contribution you should make
# Total contributions = tithing owed added to the fast offering payment

# Display the Total contributions
```

## 3.2 - Your Project

For your project, copy the above code to your Python editor and complete the program.

Here is a example of the output of your project

```
Enter how much money you earned: 100
Enter how much you would like to pay for fast offerings: 12
Total contributions = 22.0
```

# 4 - Submitting

After you have finished writting and testing your program:

1. Take a screen shot of your code and the results of running your code.  You should be able to do this in one screen shot.  If not, take screen shots of each.
2. Upload your screen shot image(s) to the Assignment Section in I-Learn for the course.  You will find an item for this project.
